### Hi there, I'm Drew nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with experience in Swift, Python and JavaScript. I primarily focus on iOS development, which I have been doing for the past 7+ years. My expertise spans building UI, implementing business logic, automated testing and devOps.

I recently worked as an iOS Engineer at [DAZN](https://dazngroup.com/) where I was involved in a lot of interesting projects and features, most notably building features to provide support for [NFL Game Pass International](https://www.dazn.com/en-US/news/football/dazn-and-nfl-sign-long-term-global-deal-from-2023-season/7azf7nio2pm11mvim1ypoi711) globally through DAZN.

In 2015, after graduating from [MEST Africa](https://meltwater.org/), I co-founded [Ampersand Technologies Ltd](https://ampersandllc.co), where I served as Tech Lead. In this role, I had the opportunity to provide technical vision and leadership for the company as well as provide mentorship for entry-level engineers and interns.

<!-- I contribute actively to opensource through Greenstand. -->

<!-- In my spare time when I am not coding, I like to play with my arduino. I am currently building a water-level monitor which you can follow along here. -->
